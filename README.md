## üìé Using File Attachments

You can attach various file types to your conversations:

1. Click the paperclip icon in the chat input area
2. Select a file from your computer (supports images, documents, code files)
3. The file will be previewed before sending
4. Type your message or send directly to let the AI analyze the file
5. For images, you can click on them to view in full size

## üéôÔ∏è Audio Transcription

Interview Coder can transcribe audio in real-time, making it perfect for interviews, meetings, and presentations:

1. Make sure you have a Google Gemini API key configured
2. Press `‚åò + S` (Mac) or `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) to start audio transcription
3. When prompted, allow access to your microphone and system audio
4. A transcription window will appear showing the captured text in real-time
5. Press the same shortcut again to stop transcription
6. The transcription window will remain open until manually closed

**Note:** For system audio transcription, you may need to select a display or window to share when prompted. This allows the app to capture both microphone and system audio simultaneously.
